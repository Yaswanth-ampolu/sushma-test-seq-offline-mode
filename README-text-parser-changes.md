# Spring Test App Text Parser Changes

## Overview

The Spring Test App has been modified to remove the regex-based text parsing functionality from the `text_parser.py` file and its dependencies. This change simplifies the application by relying solely on spring specifications from settings rather than attempting to extract parameters from natural language text.

## Changes Made

1. **Simplified `text_parser.py`**
   - Removed all regex-based parsing functionality
   - Changed `is_sequence_request()` to always return `False`
   - Modified `extract_parameters()` to only return a basic dictionary with timestamp and prompt
   - Kept JSON extraction logic for processing API responses
   - Simplified `format_parameter_text()` to perform basic string conversion without adding units

2. **Modified `chat_panel.py`**
   - Removed the import of `extract_parameters` from `text_parser`
   - Changed the message handling to create a simple parameters dictionary instead of trying to extract parameters from text
   - Kept the spring specifications parsing which is still needed to interpret structured input

3. **Updated `together_api_client.py`**
   - Removed imports from `text_parser`
   - Implemented simplified versions of the required functions directly in the file:
     - `format_parameter_text()`: Formats parameters for display or API prompts
     - `extract_command_sequence()`: Extracts JSON sequence data from text
     - `extract_error_message()`: Extracts error messages from API responses

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Code**: Removed complex regex patterns and parsing logic that was difficult to maintain.
2. **More Reliable**: Spring specifications are now handled only through the UI or structured input, eliminating potential parsing errors.
3. **Clearer Responsibilities**: The application now has a more defined flow for handling spring specifications.

## Impact

The application still supports all the main features, including:

- Setting spring specifications through the UI
- Parsing structured specification text with clear field labels
- Generating and displaying test sequences
- Analyzing existing sequences
- Exporting results

The only functionality that has been removed is the ability to extract spring parameters from conversational text using regex patterns. Users are now expected to:

1. Enter spring specifications through the UI form
2. Use the structured format when inputting specifications in chat
3. Upload specification PDFs using the document parser (if implemented)

This change aligns with the goal of making the application more focused and reliable by using explicit spring specifications.
